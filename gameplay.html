                Dead Man Walking delivers a tense and immersive survival experience, giving you full control over movement and combat. 
                Walk carefully, sprint to escape danger, or jump over obstacles to navigate the terrain efficiently.
                Stamina is critical to survival. Instead of automatic regeneration, you must stop and take controlled breaths to recover 
                energy, adding realism and strategy to every decision.      
                Combat offers flexibility—you can switch between a knife and a gun to suit the situation. Use the knife for silent, 
                close-quarters takedowns and to conserve ammo, or rely on the gun for ranged power when the threat demands it.               
                Every move you make comes with consequences, creating a constant balance between movement, stamina, and weapon choice as you 
                fight to stay alive..</p>

                    The death screen in Dead Man Walking is designed to be both impactful and informative, offering players a brief but 
                    meaningful pause to reflect on their journey. When a player dies, the screen fades in with a dark, atmospheric overlay 
                    that reinforces the game's gritty, post-apocalyptic tone. Subtle visual and audio cues enhance the emotional weight of 
                    the moment, immersing the player in the aftermath of their failure. In addition to its cinematic presentation, the death
                    screen provides quick and intuitive access to essential options—allowing players to instantly retry the level, return to
                    the main menu, or take a moment before diving back into the action.
