            <p>All the models and animations used in Dead Man Walking were carefully sourced from Mixamo.com and Fab.com, 
            ensuring that every character movement is smooth, realistic, and immersive. By leveraging high-quality animations, 
            I was able to create fluid and lifelike motion for both the player character and the undead enemies, enhancing the 
            overall gameplay experience. For the zombie NPCs, I incorporated two different typse of zombies to introduce variety and prevent the horde 
            from feeling repetitive. Each model was chosen to reflect different stages of decay, clothing styles, and physical characteristics, making 
            every encounter feel more unpredictable and engaging. Some zombies wear tattered remnants of their former lives, 
            while others showcase grotesque wounds and exposed bone, reinforcing the eerie and unsettling atmosphere of the game.</p>

            <p>The church stands in the midst of the forest, constructed from aged green wood that has faded and weathered over time, giving it 
            a timeworn, almost forgotten presence in the dense wilderness. Its wooden walls are rough, with visible knots and imperfections, 
            each board telling a story of years spent battling the elements. The green hue of the wood has long since dulled, now blending 
            with the surrounding moss and underbrush, making it seem as though the building is an integral part of the forest itself. The 
            roof, covered in a thick layer of moss and lichen, has a slight slope, showing deep grooves where water has eroded the 
            once-sturdy structure. Some areas of the roof are beginning to sag, the wood warped and weakened by constant exposure to rain, 
            wind, and time. The edges of the roof are chipped and splintered, with dark patches of rot spreading across the shingles, 
            evidence of its battle against nature’s unforgiving forces.</p>

                One of the early concept drawings for Dead Man Walking was a small top-down sketch of the forested environment that would 
                define the game's setting. The drawing outlined dense clusters of trees, winding paths, and natural clearings, giving a 
                rough sense of how the landscape would take shape. Though simple, it helped establish the overall layout, influencing 
                decisions on terrain flow and player movement. This early visualization set the stage for refining the forest’s atmosphere, 
                ensuring it felt immersive, haunting, and filled with the tension of the post-apocalyptic world.
